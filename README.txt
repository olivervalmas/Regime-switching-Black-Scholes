The notebooks in this folder serve as supplementary material for this project.

Each notebook has been exported into HTML to persist the outputs - if you only want to view the notebooks, use the HTML versions. If you would like to run them, use the notebooks themselves - do so at your own risk.

Regime-switching Calibration.ipynb:

This notebook contains the calibration logic and various interactive plots that demonstrate the fit. It also contains error plots and the code for downloading data from Yahoo! Finance. The calibration itself is not optimised and can take 15+ minutes.

SDE and Continuous-time Markov Chain Simulation.ipynb:

This contains simulation of the CTMC and plots some example path processes.

Markov chain Evaluation.ipynb:

This notebooks contains the evaluation of our CTMC and some plots.

Volatility Smiles, Volatility Term Structures and Monte-Carlo Simulations.ipynb:

This notebook contains code to plot individual volatility smiles, term structures and surfaces. It also contains the optimised Monte Carlo option pricer, which can be configured to use any initial state. It also includes example plots of random GBM processes for demonstration.
